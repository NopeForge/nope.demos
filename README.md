# README

This repository provides a serie of demos for the Nope Forge project. The
easiest way to interact with them is to check them out by loading the `demos.py`
script into the viewer which can be downloaded on [nopeforge.org][nope-www].

## Generate all the demos

In order to export video files of all the demos, one can run the following:

```sh
python render.py
```

To update only one file, remove it from the `output` directory and run that
script again.
